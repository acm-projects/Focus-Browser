# Focus Browser
Focus Browser is a web browser designed to keep users on track while studying or doing research. Users can set goals, restrict themselves from distracting websites, and access statistics that indicate how much time they spend off track.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A simple application capable of rendering a web page (likely using WebView or some similar widget) and navigating web pages (e.g. back button, forward button, etc.). The focusing features of the browser should be in their most basic form (i.e. simply allowing users to block themselves from given URLs for some period of time).

## Project Milestones
1. [ ] Set up a weekly meeting time
1. [ ] Understand Git/Github
1. [ ] Decide on tech stack/install required software
1. [ ] Design the browser and create program models (e.g. UML, XD, pseudocode, etc.)
1. [ ] Create a simple desktop application that can display web pages
1. [ ] Add basic controls to browser
1. [ ] Add tracking and web site type restriction features
1. [ ] Work on stretch goals if there is time

## Stretch Goals
Add QOL features that make the browser easier/better to use, such as:
* Securing the browser using Google Safe Browsing API
* Allowing users to restrict themselves from certain types of websites using the SimilarWeb API
* Ability for the browser to interact directly with YouTube so users can watch educational videos (e.g. PatrickJMT, Khan Academy, etc.) and only get counted as “off track” for non-educational videos (e.g. Music Videos)
* Tabs
* Bookmarks
* The ability to print a web page from within the browser
* Webpage source code viewing option
